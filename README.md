An Image Web Scrapper developed as a component of the A2I2 ReOpen research project for Floorplan Image Analysis. This component attempts to retrieve bulk images from the designated image source.

## Input

_Note_: This URL is expected to be from an image engine with a paging system (e.g. Google Images, Yandex Images, etc)
## Output
Various images output to a local "Temp" folder
_Note_: If for whatever reason an image is unable to be downloaded, the console will display an error and proceed to the next image in the queue
